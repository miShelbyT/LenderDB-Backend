This freelance project was pair programmed with Jonny Hakimian. Utilizes Postgres db with a single lender model and is used with a front end that was deployed via Netlify and is hosted [here](www.ucglendersurvey.com). (Please do not submit any data into this database as it is being used by a RE capital firm!)

Upgraded Ruby to 3.0.1 for deployment to Heroku.
